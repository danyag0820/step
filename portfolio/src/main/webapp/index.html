      <p>Hi! My name is Danya, and this is my portfolio! I'm a rising junior at Wellesley College, 
          studying computer science and philosophy. During this wacky quarantine time, I've
          been really into reddit, bloons tower defense, and hiking. Below
          is an image of a scared cat I found on the internet, and my Google account profile picture!
      </p>
      <img class = 'introImages' src = '/images/scaredCat.jpg' alt = 'Scared Jumping Cat' >
      <img class = 'introImages' src = '/images/IMG-0479.JPG' alt = 'My profile picture' >
      
      <p>Some of my favorite classes that I've taken (in no particular order): </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Combinatorics & Graph Theory</li>
          <li>American Migration Myths</li>
          <li>Ethics of Technology</li>
          <li>Intro to Computer Programming (aka going from what on earth is cs?? to maybe this
              is something I could major in!)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can find my linkedin <a href = 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/danya-gao-b4ab261a9/'>here!</a>
      I made it recently and am really new at how to use it, so suggestions are always welcome :) </p>
